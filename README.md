#Hangman API
A minimal version of a hangman API.

##Start a new game
POST: /games

At the start of the game a random word will be picked from a list.

##Guess a started game
PUT: /games/:id

Guessing a correct letter doesnâ€™t decrement the amount of tries left
Only valid characters are a-z

##Response (JSON)
A successful response will contain the following fields:
* word: representation of the word that is being guessed (with dots for letters that have not been guessed yet, e.g. "aw.so..")
* tries_left: the number of tries left to guess the word (starts at 11)
* status: current status of the game (busy|fail|success)
